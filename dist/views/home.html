        <div class="disclaimer">disclaimer: this game is by no means comprehensive and meant as a guide only. <br>a comprehensive list of all 1,200+ clubs can be found <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/campus-life/student-organizations" target="_blank">here</a>, but that's a lot to sort through. <br>wouldn't it be more fun to play this game?</div>
